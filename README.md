This repository contains code for malaria species classification using PyTorch and Faster R-CNN object detection and classification model. The model is tested with different backbone architectures to achieve accurate detection and classification of malaria species.
Overview

Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by parasites that are transmitted to people through the bites of infected mosquitoes. Accurate detection and classification of malaria species from microscopic images play a crucial role in diagnosis and treatment.

This project aims to develop a deep learning model using PyTorch and Faster R-CNN architecture to detect and classify malaria species from microscopic images. The model is trained on a dataset containing images of malaria-infected blood smears.
Features

    Implementation of Faster R-CNN for object detection and classification.
    Training the model using PyTorch on a custom dataset.
    Evaluation of model performance using various backbone architectures.
    Testing the model on unseen data to assess its accuracy and generalization.

Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of microscopic images of malaria-infected blood smears. Each image is annotated with bounding boxes and labels indicating the presence and species of malaria parasites. Four Malaria parasites species are considered in this study.
